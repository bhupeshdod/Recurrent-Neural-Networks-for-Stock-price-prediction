# Recurrent-Neural-Networks-for-Stock-price-prediction

This project focuses on predicting the next dayâ€™s stock price based on the previous three days' data, including Volume, Open, High, and Low prices. It leverages Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, due to their effectiveness in handling time-series data with long and short-term dependencies.

**Dataset** <br>
The dataset used (q2_dataset) includes the following columns: Date, Close/Last, Volume, Open, High, and Low. The primary task is to predict the "Open" price for the next day using the past three days' data.

**Data Preparation** <br>
Feature Engineering: The dataset is transformed so that each sample contains data from 3 consecutive days, resulting in 12 features.
Target Variable: The "Open" price of the fourth day is used as the target.
Splitting: The dataset is randomized and split into 70% training and 30% testing sets, saved as train_data_RNN.csv and test_data_RNN.csv, respectively.

**Preprocessing** <br>
The training dataset is loaded and separated into features (x_train) and target (y_train).
Standard scaling normalization is applied to the features, normalizing them to a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
The data is reshaped to fit the LSTM model's input requirements.

**Model Architecture** <br>
The network consists of two LSTM layers with 48 and 82 units, followed by a fully connected output layer with linear activation.
The model has a total of 52,651 parameters.
It is trained for 155 epochs with a batch size of 8.

**Results** <br>
Training Loss: Converged to approximately 10.
Validation Loss: Converged to approximately 9.
Training MAE: Approximately 2.0.
Validation MAE: Approximately 2.06.

**Testing** <br>
MSE on Test Dataset: Approximately 13.5.
MAE on Test Dataset: Approximately 2.16.
Observations: Most predictions align closely with true values, with some deviations.

**Additional Experiments** <br>
Experimenting with the number of days used for features showed variable results. Increasing days can provide more historical context but may also introduce complexity and noise
